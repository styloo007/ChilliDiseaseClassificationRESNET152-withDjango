# Chilli Disease Classification with RESNET152 and Django

This project utilizes a deep learning model based on the RESNET152 architecture to classify diseases in chili plants. The model has been trained on a dataset of chili plant images and can classify them into various disease categories.

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a tool for farmers and agricultural experts to accurately and efficiently identify diseases in chili plants. By leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly the powerful RESNET152 architecture, we strive to achieve high accuracy in disease classification.

The main objective of this project is to empower farmers with a reliable solution that can assist them in detecting and diagnosing diseases in chili plants early on, thereby enabling timely interventions and minimizing crop losses. With the ability to classify chili plant diseases automatically, farmers can take proactive measures to protect their crops and improve agricultural productivity.

Through the integration of RESNET152-based deep learning model with a Django web application, this project offers a user-friendly interface for uploading chili plant images and obtaining disease classification results in real-time. This tool not only enhances the efficiency of disease diagnosis but also serves as a valuable resource for agricultural research and development.


To run the Django application, execute the following command:

```bash
cd frontend

python manage.py runserver
